# Uber NYC Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Uber's operations in New York City (NYC) using data imported from a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle. The goal is to gain insights into Uber trip patterns, trends, and geographical distribution within NYC. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial analysis, and an automated analysis for a comprehensive understanding of Uber's operations.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several sections, each addressing specific aspects of the analysis. Below is an overview of what each section covers:

### 1. Data Import
The first step is to import the data from the provided CSV file. Ensure that the data is correctly loaded and that you have access to the necessary libraries and dependencies.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Perform data cleaning to ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis. This includes:
-Removing duplicate records, if any.
-Handling missing or null values.
-Converting data types as needed.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, explore and visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights. The following visualizations are required:

#### 3.1 Quantity of Uber Trips by Month and by Day
Create a pivot table to summarize the quantity of Uber trips by month.
Generate a bar chart to visualize the monthly distribution of Uber trips.
Create a pivot table to summarize the quantity of Uber trips by day.
Generate a bar chart to visualize the daily distribution of Uber trips.

#### 3.2 Hours with Most Uber Trips by Day
Create a pivot table to identify the hours with the most Uber trips by day.
Generate a line chart to visualize the hourly trends for each day.

#### 3.3 Number of Active Vehicles by Dispatching Base
Create a box plot chart to understand the distribution of active vehicles by dispatching base.
Create a violin plot chart to visualize the number of active vehicles across different bases.

### 4. Spatial Analysis
Perform spatial analysis to identify zones or areas in NYC where Uber trips are most concentrated. Utilize geographical data, if available, to create heatmaps or other relevant visualizations.

### 5. Automated Analysis
Develop an automated analysis that creates a gradient pivot table to explain the hours vs. the days of the month with the most Uber trips. This automated analysis should provide a dynamic and user-friendly way to explore the data.

## Dependencies
List any external libraries, packages, or tools required to run this project. Ensure that users have access to these dependencies for successful execution.
